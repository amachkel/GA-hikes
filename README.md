# Georgia Hikes
## Description
Have you ever tried to go hiking in Georgia? Typically you will have a hard time trying to find trails to hike and places to park when you arrive. Our Georgia Hikes app allows users to view our interactive map that shows them where they can hike and park. This app also allows the user to view the weather for that day they are planning on getting out there!

We developed this app through the most advanced coding bootcamp available on the market at Georgia Tech.
We provide a fast interactive user experience, current and upcoming weather for user hikes, directions and trail information.

Please visit our app Georgia Hikes if you are interested in hiking Georgia's top rated trails.
